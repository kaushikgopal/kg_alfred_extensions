This repository contains my [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com/) extensions and others' Alfred extensions that I've customized to my taste.

# INSTALLATION

After ensuring that you have Alfred installed, just download the extension and double click.

# AVAILABLE SCRIPTS

1.  Share with Dropbox and goo.gl URL shorterner

    + This places your file in your Dropbox Public folder and shortens the final url with goo.gl.
    + Make sure you key in your correct Dropbox ID
    + I've chosen goo.gl because adding a ".info" at the end of the URL gives you nice tracking stats
    + There's a nice fallback that just spits out your default url if goo.gl fails for some strange reason.
